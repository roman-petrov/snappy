# 📐 DRY and single source of truth

## 📐 Norm

Don't duplicate logic — extract shared functions/constants. For data, keep one canonical place; derive the rest. Don't
store the same fact in multiple variables/configs.

## 🔍 Detect

Find similar code blocks or parallel lists/values that must stay in sync.

## 🔧 Fix

Extract shared logic; keep one source and derive

## 📝 Examples

### ❌ Bad

```ts
const a = items.filter(i => i.active);
const b = items.filter(i => i.active);
```

### ✅ Good

```ts
const active = items.filter(i => i.active);
```
