# 📘 ESLint

## Exceptions at the top of the file

When you need to disable ESLint rules for a file, **always place exceptions at the beginning of the file**:

- Put each rule on its own line: **one `/* eslint-disable rule-name */` per line**. Do not list multiple rules in one
  comment.
- Do not add descriptions to disable comments (no `-- reason` or inline explanation).
- Do not scatter disables throughout the code; do not use `eslint-disable-next-line` for whole blocks — move the rule to
  the top of the file.

**Example (at the top of the file, before imports):**

```ts
/* eslint-disable no-console */
```
