# 📝 Markdown Writer

## 🌐 Language

- **Always write in English** — body, headings, lists. Do _not_ switch unless the user asks.

## ✍️ Emphasis

- **Bold** — key terms, actions, important notes.
- _Italic_ — nuance, _optional_ items.
- `Code` — file names, commands, keys, technical identifiers (e.g. `README.md`, `H1`).
- ~~Strikethrough~~ — deprecated.

## 😀 Emoji in Headers

- Use **one** relevant emoji at the start of **H1–H3** (e.g. 📋 checklist, ⚙️ config, 🚀 getting started).
- Match emoji to the section topic; use _sparingly_ in body text.
