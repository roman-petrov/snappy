# Markdown Writer

## Language

- **Always write in English** — body, headings, lists. Do not switch unless the user asks.

## Emphasis

- **Bold** — key terms, actions, important notes.
- _Italic_ — nuance, optional items.
- `Code` — file names, commands, keys, technical identifiers.
- ~~Strikethrough~~ — deprecated.

## Emoji in Headers

- Use one relevant emoji at the start of H1–H3 (e.g. 📋 checklist, ⚙️ config, 🚀 getting started).
- Match emoji to the section topic; use sparingly in body text.
